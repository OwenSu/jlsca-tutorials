    "# RHme3 White Box Unboxing qualifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to recover the key from the [whitebox qualifier challenge of Rhme 2017](https://github.com/Riscure/Rhme-2017/tree/master/prequalifications/White%20Box%20Unboxing). The challenge can be completely solved using the SideChannelMarvels framework as described in [this Deadpool writeup](https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/Deadpool/tree/master/wbs_aes_rhme3_prequal). Here we do it somewhat differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the wrapper from Deadpool to trace the whitebox binary with Intel Pin. For recovery, we will use Jlsca to illustrate trace pre-processing techniques that it offers. For this toy binary, the effect of these techniques is not so pronounced, however it is significant for more serious challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before computing the correlation, we perform pre-processing on the traces to automatically remove samples that are irrelevant for the analysis. Such point-of-interest selection  drastically reduces the length of traces without the visual inspection of the trace graph and manual filter configuration. As you can see from the log lines staring with `Reduction`, what remains are about 20 bits per key byte. This is what goes into correlation computation. As a result, the *total* time of the attack (and the amount of human input) is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed description of these pre-procesing techniques is available in https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/095\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation part of the attack is the same as in [Daredevil](https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/Deadpool). The output of the pre-processing could be fed out to Daredevil. However, the point selection is different per key byte, so we would need to script 16 separate Daredevil runs with different tracesets. You can do it as an exercise though.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you do not feel like tracing the binary yourself, tracesets for analysis are available alongside this notebook in [rhme2017-qual-wb-traces.tar.bz2](rhme2017-qual-wb-traces.tar.bz2)."

    "## 1. Converting the files\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Jlsca accepts the \"split binary\" format directly, we will convert the traces to bit-packed representation and save it as trs. For the short traces of this example it hardly matters, so just as an illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the current limitations of the converter we add only the input. This is enough for the attack but we will not be able to verify the key. For this challenge, the key will be distinguishable by its entropy, but in general the converter deserves improvement. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadpool's `bin2trs` converter from `deadpool_dca.py` can also be used (see the tracing script above), it just does not pack the bits. As an excercise, you can run the attack below on the `mem_addr1_rw1_100_42808.trs` and see what happens."
