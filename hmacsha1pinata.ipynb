    "# What's this?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes an analysis of measurements taken from a Core417I board (the one like [Core 407I](http://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Core407I) but featuring a version of the STM32F4 chip with HW crypto accelerator). The board together with a custom sofware package is available from Riscure as a training target dubbed [Piñata](https://www.riscure.com/product/pinata-training-target/). Since vanilla Piñata software doesn't do HMAC SHA1, I (@ceesb) cut and paste some of ST's reference code. Then, I added a command on the Piñata that feeds back a SHA1 output into the HMAC SHA1 computation so that Piñata does many HMACs per input sent from the PC:\n",

    "i = 0\n",
    "iterations = MSB_UINT32(readfromserial(4))\n",
    "input = readfromserial(20)\n",
    "for i < iterations:\n",
    "   triggerUP()\n",

    "=>   df <UINT32 MSB iterations> <20 bytes MSB input>\n",
    "<=   <20 bytes output of last HMAC SHA1 iteration>\n",

    "# TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "Attack doesn't perform very well, key of inner SHA cannot be recovered. Outer SHA not tried.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "[Riscure EM probe (LS)](https://www.riscure.com/product/em-probe-station/) over the chip, right in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Picoscope in rapid block mode, 4096 encryptions per scope fetch.  On receiving the 4096 traces on the PC we compute the inputs and store them in a trace set. Since we know the key, we verify that the last HMAC output of the Piñata matches with what we expect, so we know for sure all traces match the inputs. Obviously the acquisition is done with a Julia script, similar to piposcope.jl in Jlsca's example folder, but send me a ping if you want it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquired > 1M traces of 3900 samples at 1Gs/s in *less than 15 minutes*. 3.5Gb 7-zipped trace set [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-My9BsChztIM21sdWxWRWRrZGs).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attack definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The attack is the same as described in Section 3.4 in this [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-25915-4_19) by Belaid and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take a look at SHA1 HMAC using the input. The key itself cannot be recovered since there is no differential data being mixed with the key. The two SHA1 states themselves are sufficient to create arbitrary HMACs. One can also attack the outer SHA1 using an output attack, but this is not shown here (although [Jlsca](https://github.com/Riscure/Jlsca) implements this attack too). We'll only be looking at the inner SHA1.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain this attack, we first define some terms:\n",
    "* a0,b0,c0,d0,e0: the 160-bit SHA1 state we are to recover, in 5 32-bit numbers\n",
    "* W0 - W3: the attacker controlled and known 32-bit inputs\n",
    "* T0-T3: the value of T for rounds 0-3\n",
    "* F0-F3: the output value of the F function for rounds 0-3\n",
    "* Rot(x,a): rotates x left by a bits\n",
    "* Ch(a,b,c) = (a & b) XOR (~a & c)\n",
    "\n",
    "We then roll out first 4 rounds of the inner SHA1 loop in the terms defined above (constants omitted):\n",
    "```\n",
    "T0 = Rot(a0, 5) + Ch(b0, c0, d0) + e0 + W0\n",
    "F0 = Ch(b0, c0, d0)\n",
    "\n",
    "T1 = Rot(T0, 5) + Ch(a0, Rot(b0, 30), c0) + d0 + W1\n",
    "F1 = Ch(a0, Rot(b0, 30), c0)\n",
    "\n",
    "T2 = Rot(T1, 5) + Ch(T0, Rot(a0, 30), Rot(b0, 30)) + c0 + W2\n",
    "F2 = Ch(T0, Rot(a0, 30), Rot(b0, 30))\n",
    "\n",
    "T3 = Rot(T2, 5) + Ch(T1, Rot(T0, 30), Rot(a0, 30)) + Rot(b0, 30) + W3\n",
    "F3 = Ch(T1, Rot(T0, 30), Rot(a0, 30))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The SHA1 input attack steps are then:\n",
    "1. DPA attack on 32-bit modular addition to guess \"Rot(a0, 5) + Ch(b0, c0, d0)\" and predict \"T0\" since we know \"W0\" \n",
    "2. DPA attack on 32-bit modular addition to guess \"Ch(a0, Rot(b0, 30), c0) + d0\" and predict \"T1\" since we know \"W1\" and \"Rot(T0, 5)\" \n",
    "3. DPA attack on Ch function to guess \"Rot(a0, 30)\" and predict \"F3\" since we know \"T1\" and \"Rot(T0, 30)\" \n",
    "4. DPA attack on Ch function to guess \"Rot(b0, 30)\" and predict \"F2\" since we know \"T0\" and \"Rot(a0, 30)\"\n",
    "5. DPA attack on 32-bit modular addition to guess \"c0\" and predict \"T2\" since we know \"Rot(T1, 5) + Ch(T0, Rot(a0, 30), Rot(b0, 30))\" and \"W2\" \n",
    "\n",
    "These 5 attacks allow us to recover the secret SHA1 state a0,b0,c0,d0,e0.  DPA attacks 1-5 are recovering 32-bit numbers and in order to enumerate the guesses we need to split the attacks up in smaller (typically 8-bits or less) attack so that the key space can be enumerated. How to split up the attacks is described in this [paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.94.7333&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Lemke, Schramm and Paar. Note that DPA attack n depends on the output of attack n-1 for n > 1. In Jlsca terms we'd call these attack *phases*. For DPA 3 and 4 multiple parts of the secret can be recovered simulteaneously since they're independent. Within a *phase* you can therefore have multiple *targets*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Jlsca, the SHA1 attack is split up in 14 phases and targets as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Phase 1, target 1: byte 0 of DPA 1\n",
    "* Phase 2, target 1: byte 1 of DPA 1\n",
    "* Phase 3, target 1: byte 2 of DPA 1\n",
    "* Phase 4, target 1: byte 3 of DPA 1\n",
    "* Phase 5, target 1: byte 0 of DPA 2\n",
    "* Phase 6, target 1: byte 1 of DPA 2\n",
    "* Phase 7, target 1: byte 2 of DPA 2\n",
    "* Phase 8, target 1: byte 3 of DPA 2\n",
    "* Phase 9, targets 1-8, 8 nibbles of DPA 3. The reason we attack nibbles is that we constructed the Ch target function to take 2 4-bits inputs and produces one 4-output. We can easily conditionally average on 2 4-bit (8-bits) of input, but not much more than that.\n",
    "* Phase 10, targets 1-4, 4 bytes of DPA 4. The reason we *don't* attack nibbles here is that one of the Ch target function inputs, Rot(b0,30), is a constant. Since it's constant, it doesn't affect the number of averages so we can take 8-bits of the T0 input to Ch and guess an 8-bits output.\n",
    "* Phase 11, target 1: byte 0 of DPA 5\n",
    "* Phase 12, target 1: byte 1 of DPA 5\n",
    "* Phase 13, target 1: byte 2 of DPA 5\n",
    "* Phase 14, target 1: byte 3 of DPA 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that this attack only uses the first 12 bytes of the input! (W0, W1 and W2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that for HMAC we need to perform the SHA1 attack two times, but we don't in this notebook. "
